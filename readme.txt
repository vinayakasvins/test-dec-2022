Define the Lambda function resource in the configuration file.
 You will need to provide the runtime, handler, and source code for the function.
 The runtime should be set to "java8" and the handler should be the fully qualified name of the main class in your Spring Boot application.
 The source code can be provided as a local file or from a location in an S3 bucket.
